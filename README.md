### Business Problem

Predicting Diabetes to Improve Preventive Healthcare and Patient Outcomes: In many healthcare systems, identifying individuals at risk for diabetes early can significantly improve outcomes by enabling timely intervention. Diabetes is a chronic disease with substantial healthcare costs and long-term complications if left unmanaged. 

##### Problem Statement 
How can we use data to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes, enabling healthcare providers to reduce disease progression and associated costs?

### Use of the Machine Learning Model
##### Benefits
1. Early Detection:
Identifying at-risk individuals before they develop severe symptoms can lead to better health outcomes.

2. Cost Reduction:
By preventing complications, the healthcare system can save costs associated with advanced diabetes treatments (e.g., dialysis, surgeries).

3. Personalized Care:
Patients can receive tailored advice and interventions based on their risk profile.

4. Efficiency in Screening:
Automating risk assessment allows clinicians to focus on care delivery rather than manual triaging.
